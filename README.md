# Welcome

`Executioner` is a little Flask WebApp that facilitates the task of starting and stopping Systemd's services on Linux machines right from the comfort of your browser.
It also allows the execution pre-defined commands and custom scripts.

This project uses Python's Flask in the backend, and jQuery in the frontend.
Both ends are communicated by passing JSON messages through a RESTful AJAX API.

NOTE: `Ececutioner` is currently in development state.  **Do not use in production environments.**
